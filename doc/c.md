# C-based linters (`check-c`)

There are currently 13 linters implemented.

## `-Wbool-conversion`

Checks for implicit conversions to bool.

## `-Wborrow-check`

Checks for borrow-checker violations in C code.

This linter implements a Rust-like borrow checker for C. It tracks ownership,
moves, and borrows of pointers marked with `__attribute__((owned))`.

It also makes conservative assumptions about un-annotated functions to ensure
soundness: it assumes the return value of a function borrows from all its
non-owned pointer arguments.

## `-Wcallback-data`

Checks that the context pointer passed to a callback matches the expected type inferred from the callback's first argument.

## `-Wcallback-discipline`

Ensures callback discipline is followed.

Callback and userdata fields should only be mutated within registry
functions (functions that simply assign a parameter to a callback field).
Registry functions themselves must remain simple and side-effect free.

## `-Wcallback-params`

Checks that the parameter names of a callback match its definition.

## `-Wcast`

Checks for disallowed casts between incompatible types.

## `-Wconversion`

Checks for disallowed implicit conversions.

## `-Wmemcpy`

Checks compatibility of dst and src in memcpy/memcmp.

## `-Wmemset`

Checks for memset calls on types that contain pointers.

## `-Wsize-arg`

Checks that the size argument passed to a function matches the array size of the preceding argument.

## `-Wsizeof`

Checks for `sizeof(buf)` where `buf` is a pointer instead of an array.

## `-Wstrict-typedef`

Implements strict typedef checking.

This linter ensures that logically distinct types (represented by different
typedefs) are not accidentally mixed, even if they have the same underlying
representation. This is particularly useful for identifiers, indices, and
role-based types.

## `-Wvoid-call`

Checks that the first statement of a function with a `void*` parameter casts it to a specific type.
